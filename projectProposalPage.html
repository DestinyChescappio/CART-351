    <h1 style="font-size:48px; font-family:monospace;">Project Proposal: Aurora Poetry</h1>
    <h2 style="font-size: 26px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: italic;">Three Questions: The Major Themes</h2>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bold;"> 1. What is your starting topic? What importance does it hold for you? For others? Why is it important to make this topic into an explorable networked space? </h3>
<p>My starting topic is exploring traditional methods of Indigenous representation in the art industry through visual storytelling and mythical legends. I believe as an Indigenous digital artist, the medium I choose to portray my culture is part of the major message. The major message is cultural identities in the future living in harmony of technology is important as an individual; but also essential to other diversities to maintain peace and reconciliation when representing cultural values in storytelling. As an Indigenous artist, I always attempt to represent my culture in different aspects through visual depictions of history and mythical storytelling. With the method of archival research and science fiction of Indigenous imaginaries of the future with technology, my topic is exploring the mythical storytelling aspect of Indigenous cultures through the northern lights, also known as aurora borealis. In my research I have not only learned the scientific aspect of aurora borealis, but other cultures have different values and mythical storytelling concerning the phenomena. Specifically, I want to be able to bring this experience from my knowledge of Indigenous storytelling about northern lights, that will then be interactive and have an impact on the viewer. This impact is to have the viewer gain an understanding of diverse ways of storytelling and poetry; specifically Indigenous legends and poetry about northern lights. </p>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;"> 2. Think about the kind of relationship you wish to encourage between your users and this space. How can you use this space to destabilize the users and make them reflect on themselves, their environment and society? </h3>
<p>Now that I have established that there are numerous other cultures that have different values and fictional legends about aurora borealis, I want to be able to establish that northern lights is more than one of nature’s events, it a shared universal experience. This impact is to have the viewer gain an understanding of diverse ways of storytelling and poetry; specifically Indigenous legends and poetry about northern lights from my perspective. The act of bringing up diversity in the realm of visual storytelling and digital interactivity would create the intimate experience of living within a legend and being able to communicate with a phenomena such as the aurora borealis in an explorable networked space. This is achieved through retrieving data from Indigenous poems from various perspectives and storytelling about the northern lights. These various poems or legends will give a communicational experience between the user and the aurora borealis. The visuals of the aurora borealis will be 3D animations that will visually change when a poem is read by the user, and overtime, the user will gain a connection with nature’s phenomena by using mythical legends. The visual animations’ changes acts as a response to the user’s language when reading the poem out loud. This visual response component will have the user reflect on the value and experience of Indigenous legends, specifically about auroras, and may relate to the northern lights as it is a shared phenomena through storytelling and values. </p>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;"> 3. Think about the notion of empowerment. Will your "space" help, challenge, teach, enable collaboration, understanding between user(s)? How and Why? </h3>
<p>The notion of empowerment upon the user within the space of aurora borealis’ storytelling will enable other Indigenous artists (or other diverse artists) into bringing traditional values, such as storytelling, into bringing legends to life in a technological space. Though not many take the time to research and learn each and every Indigenous fictional legend, I believe bringing it into an interactive space of technology would establish a new beginning; a fun and interactive way of learning and becoming one with the legend by communicating with the aurora borealis through poetry. Once the user has read the poem, theoretically communicating with the aurora borealis, the visual animations changing will act as a response. Essentially, the animation will also come with sound design, which will be the user’s voice that will be distorted and filtered to represent the northern light’s talking to the user. This will also act as a reflection of communication that the user has become part of the northern lights. The northern lights acting as a living being is what is shared across many Indigenous tribe’s legends which is a spiritual experience. A spiritual experience of other dimensional beings, a fictional approach of communicating, dancing, and singing when the phenomena occurs. Through Indigenous imaginaries and futurisms, my method of storytelling is delivered through visuals of the aurora borealis which is a major component in fictional storytelling; one of the essential parts of cultural maintenance. This cultural maintenance is captured through digital media, interactivity and communication; which brings an entirely new form of Indigenous cultural representation in translating it in technologies and digital spaces. </p>

<h2 style="font-size: 26px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: italic;">Three Similar Inspirational Projects</h2>
<p>One of the projects I am inspired by that includes user interactivity is the <a href="https://artbase.rhizome.org/wiki/Q3916">Barcode Web Counter(2008)</a> by Scott Blake. The project is a web counter that is displayed on a website that collects bar code data based on the user’s visitations on the website. The project is a depiction of a bar code represented as a fine art piece that is hung on a wall, like a painting, presented to the public to view and analyze. The bar code has the text located on the top, You are Visitor, and the number of visitors text is located on the bottom. The text that tracks the number of visitors is what is coded to collect data of how many users visited the website. On the bottom of the number of visitors’ text, there is the text Enter Site which leads to the artist’s personal website showcasing his other artworks, resume, store and contact information. There is also depictions of two individuals, a man and a woman, which represent the public viewing and analyzing the bar code. The reason I am inspired by this project is because it includes the viewers and users as part of the project which is my goal in my own project. In this case, my method of including the viewers is by having them read poetry to the aurora borealis and reflect on the impact they have on the animations. </p>
<p>A second project I am inspired by is the experiment <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/webgl-particle-audio-visualizer">Webgl Paticle Audio Visualizer</a> which is part of the Google’s Chrome Experiments in collaboration with artist, Sehyun Av Kim. The project is an abstract animation of a blob that is triggered by audio, which morphs its geometry and form. It is built with WebGL and three.js  and its particle systems seems to move along with the blob’s triggered movements from the audio. The particle system’s is transformed with color, shape and behaviour that is triggered by the user’s microphone audio. Depending on the audio’s loudness, the animated blob model’s colours intensify with the shapes growing when a sound processes through the audio output. The experiment’s website provide the project’s code which indicates the animation is a 3D model that is rendered and manipulated via the audio. The project’s model texturing and style is implemented in the code (which are displays of the model’s normal mapping in 3D design terms). This particular project I am very inspired by its usage of interactivity and Web Audio API. Its visual components and interactivity with viewer’s sounds is what is inclusive and captivating that inspires my project I plan to do.</p>
<p>Another project I am inspired is <a href="https://www.decontextualize.com/2015/08/the-ephemerides/">The Ephemerides</a> which is a robot that works with generating poetry and space probes. The project explores the realms of the impossible whether we can reimagine what poetry would look like if space probes wrote it? The artist shares his creative process by collecting data from NASA’s OPUS database which is a repository data from space probes. He then posts this collected space probe data on tumblr that includes a computer generated poetry from references of Bashō, Gary Snyder and Rae Armantrout. The artist created the source data with Pattern which parses each text from the poems into individual sentences. The poetry is generated by randomizing the selection of each poem. The images of the space probes are generated from NASA’s database of space which are raw images that are unedited and directly coming from the space probes. Each time an image is posted from the space probe, the poem is then generated with the image’s brief description of what is the target name, instrument ID, target class, and the date and time it was captured. This project has inspired me to work with poetry and think about how I would express Indigenous storytelling and poetry about northern lights. It especially inspires me to have an idea of what kind of impactful interactivity I want to pursue in my project.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 26px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: italic;">Project Originality</h2>
<p>My project, “Aurora Poetry” will establish a new medium of expressing Indigenous traditional storytelling. Since cave paintings and legends, the aurora borealis has been portrayed as a spiritual entity, a supernatural phenomena. I believe creating an art piece that represents Indigenous Futurisms through the context of legend storytelling in a digital space is a step forward to maintaining Indigenous archive and culture. It is a new method and medium to reimagine my future with bringing my culture along with me, even long after I grow old and no longer walk this earth. </p>
